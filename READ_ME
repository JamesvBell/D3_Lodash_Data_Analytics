I used Windows 10
Website for tutorial, props to them: 
http://learnjsdata.com/getting_started.html

To get started, go to Node.js and install it. This comes with NPM 
https://nodejs.org/en/

After installation, go to command Prompt in Windows and run the install server script, I used the last one 
npm install -g http-server

Then find your http-server filepath by looking in your folder. 

The tutorial assumes you know more than I did, so I used this youtube video and made it work. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa9m8321_nw

Here was my filepath in Windows, buried pretty deep and I changed my users name on my PC to protect the innocent. 

C:\Users\FirstName LastName\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\http-server

Create a new file and rename it index.html

I then copied my filepath and went back to the command prompt. 

I typed in cd and pasted the filepath and clicked enter. This is changing the directory to your new directory. 

Then type npm init and press enter, it will open the utility

Then I entered node_tutorial for the package name. Leave out the <>. 
Then kept pressing enter until I got to my name and entered my name. 

then it executed a bunch of code. 

Keep following the youtube video until you get to about the 2 minute mark. 

You need to make sure your directory is all the way to the http-server/bin on the command prompt 

I couldnt' get what they had in the video to work, but stack overflow to the rescue!!
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31328365/how-to-start-http-server-locally

add this to the end of the directory and run and your server should start!! Use the url listed on your command prompt to get it to show up. 
http-server -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1

Then go to your http site! 

I'd copy and paste that file location in a safe place
To stop the server press ctrl c

Then to start it again you'll need to cd filepath

Try turning it off and on again to get the hang of it. 




http-server -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1
